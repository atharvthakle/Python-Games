# Python Games

## A collection of classic games implemented in Python. In this repository, you'll find timeless games

• Hangman : It's a word guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to being "hanged" until they either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses.

• Snake : It is a simple game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to avoid colliding with the walls of the screen or with the snake's own body.

• Tic-Tac-Toe : It is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on the grid, and the first player to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
